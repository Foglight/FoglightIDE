plain.135=View and edit type-specific agent properties.
plain.136=View information about agents as well as perform agent-related operations, such as deploy agent packages, activate and deactivate Foglight agents, start and stop data collection for an agent, on a single host.
plain.137=This dashboard contains controls for installing, enabling, disabling, and uninstalling cartridges, as well as for viewing information about the installed cartridges.
plain.138=This dashboard allows to view information about existing components and to download them.
plain.139=The Foglight Data Management dashboard is useful for inspecting and deleting data objects, and particularly for cleaning up objects that are no longer needed.
plain.14=The {0} {1} of every {2} month(s)
plain.140=Includes a list of the derived metrics that exist in the monitoring environment and allows to add or delete derived metrics, as well as perform other metric management operations.
plain.141=Create and edit retention policies for topology types and properties of topology types.
plain.142=Includes a list of the thresholds that exist in the monitoring environment and includes mechanisms for adding and deleting thresholds.
plain.143=Topology describes the logical and physical relationships between data nodes in a model. This dashboard allows to add a new Topology Type.
plain.144=Foglight registry variables can be used in rule conditions, expressions, and actions. They are stored in the Foglight registry. A registry variable can have a global value that is available to all topology types and objects. It can also have multiple additional values associated with specific topology types or objects. In addition, these values can be configured to change at certain times. This dashboard dashboard includes a list of the registry variables that exist in the monitoring environment and includes an interface for adding and deleting registry variables.
plain.145=A rule is a piece of business logic that links a condition with a result. The result may be linked to actions. Foglight allows you to create flexible rules that can be applied to complex, interrelated data from multiple sources within your distributed system. This dashboard includes a list of the rules that exist in your monitoring environment and allows you to add or delete rules and perform other rule management operations.
plain.146=The View Audit Information dashboard allows you to select the time period for which you want to view Administration logs. Each log includes information such as the name of the user who made the change, the date and time at which the change was made, the action performed, and (if applicable) the name of the item that was changed.
plain.147=The Connection Status dashboard provides a list of Foglight Agent Manager instances connected to the Foglight Management Server. It displays the host\u2019s IP address, login time, request name, and request time following information for each Foglight Agent Manager.
plain.148=The Foglight Configuration dashboard provides a list of active port configurations, Java Virtual Machine, OS, mail settings, database, federation configuration of the current Foglight Management server.
plain.149=The Manage Licenses dashboard allows to view, install, and delete licenses for the current Foglight Management Server installation. This page consists of three areas\: Install Licenses, Licensed Capability Summary, and a listing of currently installed licenses.
plain.150=Foglight allows to gather diagnostic data from the Foglight Management Server or the Foglight Agent Manager, and save it in a support bundle. This dashboard allows to view, download and manage support bundles.
plain.151=A schedule is a calendar entry. A schedule consists of one or more schedule items. Each schedule item is effectively a sub-schedule\: it includes a start date, a time range during which it runs, a recurrence pattern, and range of recurrence. The Manage Schedules dashboard allows you to manage existing schedules, assign permissions to schedules, and other features.
plain.152=This dashboard provide detail view of the logs of the current Foglight Management Server
plain.153=Provide an overview of current Foglight Management Server's peroformance. Including database metric, JVM memory, etc...
plain.154=Custom script agents interact with the Foglight Agent Manager through the Foglight collector executable. User can use any scripting language to write scripts. Scriptbased custom agents output to standard output (stdout) and the Foglight collector reads the data and retransmits it to the Foglight Agent Manager. The Build Script Agent dashboard allows to upload an agent script to the Foglight Management Server.
plain.155=The Script Editor dashboard allows to select topology objects that exist in the monitoring environment and retrieve information about those objects. Additionally, one can utilize the function to test various user-defined scripts such as creating and manipulating objects. The primary language is Groovy.
plain.156=The Manage Groups dashboard contains a table that lists all of the groups that have been created in the Administration Module or imported from an LDAP-compatible directory service supported by Foglight, the users that belong to these groups, and the roles that have been assigned to each group.
